## ðŸŽ¨ How Material You Works

### What is Material You?
Material You is Android's dynamic theming system that:
- Extracts dominant colors from your wallpaper
- Applies them throughout the app
- Creates a personalized, cohesive look
- Adapts to light/dark mode automatically

### Color Extraction
The app uses the `dynamic_color` package which:
1. Reads your Android wallpaper
2. Extracts primary, secondary, tertiary colors
3. Generates harmonized color schemes
4. Applies them to all UI elements

## ðŸ“± How to Use

### Enable Material You:
1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Under **Preferences**, find **Color Scheme**
3. Toggle the switch to **ON**
4. See your app colors change to match your wallpaper!

### Disable Material You:
1. Go to **Settings** tab
2. Toggle **Color Scheme** to **OFF**
3. App returns to default teal/green colors

## ðŸŽ¯ What Changes with Material You

When enabled, these colors adapt to your wallpaper:
- âœ… Primary color (buttons, selected items)
- âœ… Secondary color (icons, hints)
- âœ… Surface colors (cards, backgrounds)
- âœ… All accent colors throughout the app

When disabled:
- âœ… Uses default app colors (teal/green theme)
- âœ… Consistent across all devices
