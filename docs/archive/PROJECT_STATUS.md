## 📝 Notes

### What's Working Well:
- Flutter development is smooth
- APIs are reliable and free
- Material You theming looks great
- Multi-language system is flexible
- UI is polished and modern

### Challenges:
- Place selection needs careful UX design
- ACO algorithm will be complex
- Distance calculation needs optimization
- Need to handle offline mode eventually

### Decisions Made:
- ✅ Use Flutter (not React Native)
- ✅ Use free OpenStreetMap APIs
- ✅ Material You for theming
- ✅ 5 languages initially
- ✅ SQLite for local storage

### Next Session Focus:
1. Implement place selection UI
2. Add selection state management
3. Create "Generate Route" flow
4. Start ACO algorithm research
