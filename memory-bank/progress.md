  - Better performance
  - Excellent UI toolkit
  - Strong community
- **Status**: Awaiting user confirmation

**2025-10-19: Design System**
- **Context**: User provided HTML design samples
- **Decision**: Extract design tokens and recreate in Flutter
- **Colors**: #111817 (primary), #618983 (secondary), #f0f4f4 (surface)
- **Typography**: Plus Jakarta Sans, Noto Sans
- **Status**: Documented, ready to implement

**2025-10-19: Route Algorithm**
- **Context**: User wants Ant Colony Optimization
- **Decision**: Implement custom ACO for one-way TSP
- **Parameters**: 10-20 ants, 50-100 iterations
- **Status**: Documented, to be implemented in Phase 1

**2025-10-19: Offline-First Architecture**
- **Context**: Travel app needs offline functionality
