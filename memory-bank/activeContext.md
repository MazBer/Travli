# Active Context: Travli

## Current Status
**Phase 1: Core Functionality** - Building MVP features (60% complete)

## Current Work Focus
- **NOW:** Implementing place selection interface (Phase 1.3)
- **NEXT:** Route optimization with ACO algorithm (Phase 1.4)

## Recent Changes (Oct 21, 2025)
- ✅ Completed Phase 0 (Foundation & Setup)
- ✅ Integrated Nominatim API for city search
- ✅ Integrated Overpass API for places data
- ✅ Implemented Material You dynamic theming
- ✅ Migrated to Material 3 NavigationBar
- ✅ Added 10 color seed options
- ✅ **COMPLETED full localization system (5 languages)**
- ✅ Localized all UI text (navigation, search, home, settings)
- ✅ Created search history feature
- ✅ Implemented smart city ranking by popularity
- ✅ Fixed AppBar theme (centered, bold titles)
- ✅ Redesigned search box (circular, filled background)
- ✅ Updated README with comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Created changelog system

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **NOW:** Implement place selection UI (checkboxes/toggle)
2. Handle multiple place selection state
3. Add "Generate Route" button
4. Start ACO algorithm implementation
5. Create distance matrix calculation

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Framework Decision
**DECIDED**: ✅ Flutter
- **Reasons**:
  - Developer has C# background (Dart is similar)
  - Better performance out of the box
  - Excellent UI toolkit
  - Single codebase, truly native performance
  - Strong community and documentation
- **Status**: Implemented and working

### API Strategy
**DECIDED**: ✅ Free OpenStreetMap APIs
- **City Search**: Nominatim API
  - Free, no API key required
  - Good global coverage
  - Returns coordinates and address details
- **Places Data**: Overpass API
  - Free, no API key required
  - Comprehensive POI data
  - Tourism, attractions, restaurants, etc.
- **Status**: Integrated and working
- **Future**: May add Google Places as fallback for better data quality

### Database Schema
**In Progress**: Designing local database structure
- Tables needed:
  - `cities`: id, name, country, coordinates, image_url
  - `places`: id, city_id, name, description, category, coordinates, image_url, rating
  - `routes`: id, name, city_id, created_at, is_favorite
  - `route_places`: route_id, place_id, order_index
  - `user_preferences`: key, value

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Style
- Feature-based organization
- Separation of concerns (UI, business logic, data)
- Immutable data structures
- Descriptive naming conventions

### UI/UX Patterns
- Bottom tab navigation (Home, Search, Settings)
- Card-based layouts for places
- Horizontal scrolling for recent trips
- Search with clear button
- Back button on secondary screens
- Consistent color scheme (#111817, #618983, #f0f4f4)
- Plus Jakarta Sans font family

### Development Approach
- **Functionality first, polish later**
- Build in phases with clear milestones
- Test core features before adding complexity
- Offline-first architecture from the start

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Key Insights
1. **Ant Colony Optimization** is well-suited for mobile TSP problems
   - Can be tuned for performance vs accuracy
   - Works well with 5-20 destinations
   - Need to limit iterations for real-time performance

2. **Offline-first is critical** for travel apps
   - Users often have limited connectivity while traveling
   - Local caching must be robust
   - Sync strategy needs careful planning

3. **Design samples provided** show clear patterns:
   - Clean, minimal interface
   - Image-heavy design
   - Consistent spacing and typography
   - Bottom navigation for main sections
   - List-based layouts with thumbnails

4. **User flow is straightforward**:
   - Search → Select → Optimize → Save/Share
   - Keep it simple, avoid feature bloat

### Technical Learnings
- Flutter's widget system maps well to component-based thinking
- Dart's async/await is similar to C#'s async patterns
- Local-first architecture requires careful state management
- Route optimization needs to balance accuracy with speed

## Questions & Uncertainties
1. What's the budget for API usage? (affects API choice)
2. Should we support multiple languages from the start?
3. How many places should we cache per city?
4. Should routes be shareable via deep links or export files?
5. Do we need user accounts in Phase 1, or can we delay to Phase 2?

## Blockers & Risks
- **No blockers currently**
- **Risks**:
  - API costs could escalate with usage
  - ACO performance on older devices needs testing
  - Image caching strategy needs to be efficient
  - Offline mode complexity might delay MVP

## Context for Next Session
When resuming work:
1. Review this file and progress.md
2. Check if framework decision was made
3. Continue with project initialization
4. Start implementing Phase 0 tasks
5. Reference design samples in `/memory-bank/design-samples.md` for UI implementation
