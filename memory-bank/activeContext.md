- **THEN:** Implement route type selector (walk/drive/transit)

## Recent Changes (Oct 24, 2025)

### Phase 1 Completion ✅
- ✅ **Completed entire Phase 1 MVP**
- ✅ Implemented ACO route optimization algorithm
- ✅ Added place selection with checkboxes
- ✅ Integrated Google Maps for route display
- ✅ Created offline places database (10 major cities)
- ✅ Fixed DNS errors with multiple fallback servers
- ✅ Added Android queries for Maps compatibility
- ✅ Implemented browser fallback for Maps
- ✅ Changed app name to "Travli" (capital T)

### Previous Achievements (Oct 21, 2025)
- ✅ Completed Phase 0 (Foundation & Setup)
- ✅ Integrated Nominatim API for city search
- ✅ Integrated Overpass API for places data
- ✅ Implemented Material You dynamic theming
- ✅ Full localization system (5 languages)
- ✅ Search history and smart city ranking

## Next Immediate Steps
1. **NOW:** Design UI for starting location selector
   - Option 1: Current location (GPS)
   - Option 2: Custom address/place
   - Option 3: Hotel/accommodation
2. Design UI for route type selector
   - Walking 🚶
   - Driving 🚗
   - Public transport 🚌
   - Cycling 🚴
3. Implement location permission handling
4. Integrate geocoding for custom addresses
5. Adjust ACO parameters based on transport mode

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Framework Decision
**DECIDED**: ✅ Flutter
- **Reasons**:
  - Developer has C# background (Dart is similar)
  - Better performance out of the box
  - Excellent UI toolkit
  - Single codebase, truly native performance
  - Strong community and documentation
- **Status**: Implemented and working

### API Strategy
**DECIDED**: ✅ Free OpenStreetMap APIs
- **City Search**: Nominatim API
  - Free, no API key required
  - Good global coverage
  - Returns coordinates and address details
- **Places Data**: Overpass API
  - Free, no API key required
  - Comprehensive POI data
  - Tourism, attractions, restaurants, etc.
- **Status**: Integrated and working
- **Future**: May add Google Places as fallback for better data quality

### Database Schema
**In Progress**: Designing local database structure
- Tables needed:
  - `cities`: id, name, country, coordinates, image_url
  - `places`: id, city_id, name, description, category, coordinates, image_url, rating
  - `routes`: id, name, city_id, created_at, is_favorite
  - `route_places`: route_id, place_id, order_index
  - `user_preferences`: key, value

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Style
- Feature-based organization
- Separation of concerns (UI, business logic, data)
- Immutable data structures
- Descriptive naming conventions

### UI/UX Patterns
- Bottom tab navigation (Home, Search, Settings)
- Card-based layouts for places
- Horizontal scrolling for recent trips
- Search with clear button
- Back button on secondary screens
- Consistent color scheme (#111817, #618983, #f0f4f4)
- Plus Jakarta Sans font family

### Development Approach
- **Functionality first, polish later**
- Build in phases with clear milestones
- Test core features before adding complexity
- Offline-first architecture from the start

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Key Insights
1. **Ant Colony Optimization** is well-suited for mobile TSP problems
   - ✅ Successfully implemented with 200 iterations
   - Works well with 5-20 destinations
   - Real-time performance achieved (<2 seconds)
   - Can be adjusted based on transport mode

2. **Offline-first is critical** for travel apps
   - ✅ Implemented offline database for 10 major cities
   - Users often have limited connectivity while traveling
   - DNS errors common on mobile networks
   - Multiple API fallbacks essential

3. **Network resilience is crucial**
   - Mobile networks often block/restrict DNS
   - Need multiple fallback servers (3+ recommended)
   - Offline database prevents complete failure
   - Browser fallback when native apps fail

4. **User flow is straightforward**:
   - Search → Select → Optimize → Open in Maps
   - ✅ MVP flow completed
   - **Next:** Add starting point + transport mode selection

5. **Transport mode matters**
   - Walking: slower, shorter distances preferred
   - Driving: faster, can cover more ground
   - Transit: depends on schedules, station locations
   - Cycling: medium speed, bike-friendly routes

### Technical Learnings
- Flutter's widget system maps well to component-based thinking
- Dart's async/await is similar to C#'s async patterns
- Local-first architecture requires careful state management
- Route optimization needs to balance accuracy with speed

## Questions & Uncertainties
1. ✅ RESOLVED: Using free APIs (Nominatim, Overpass)
2. ✅ RESOLVED: 5 languages implemented
3. ✅ RESOLVED: Offline database for major cities
4. ⏳ TODO: Route sharing format (Phase 2.4)
5. ✅ RESOLVED: User accounts delayed to Phase 2.3

### New Questions (Phase 2)
1. How to handle GPS permissions gracefully?
2. Should we show real-time traffic for driving routes?
3. How to estimate public transport times without API?
4. Should cycling routes avoid highways automatically?
5. Allow mixing transport modes in one route?

## Blockers & Risks

### Resolved Risks ✅
- ✅ API costs: Using free APIs
- ✅ ACO performance: Optimized and fast
- ✅ Offline mode: Implemented successfully
- ✅ DNS errors: Multiple fallbacks working

### Current Risks ⚠️
- GPS permission denial by users
- Geocoding API rate limits for custom addresses
- Transport mode accuracy without real-time data
- Battery drain from continuous GPS usage
- Offline maps size if we add map tiles

## Context for Next Session
When resuming work:
1. ✅ Phase 1 MVP completed
2. Review Phase 2 feature requirements
3. Design UI mockups for:
   - Starting location selector
   - Route type selector
4. Plan GPS permission flow
5. Research geocoding options for custom addresses
6. Consider transport mode icons and UI placement
